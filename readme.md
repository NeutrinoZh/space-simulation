# Gravitational Simulation using Classical Galilean Transformations

This project is a simple gravitational simulation implemented using classical Galilean transformations. In this simulation, particles are subjected to gravitational forces relative to each other, following Newton's laws and classical Galilean transformations.

## Overview

The simulation includes the following features:

- Calculation of gravitational forces between particles based on Newton's law of universal gravitation.
- Implementation of classical Galilean transformations to update particle positions and velocities.
- Collision handling and resolution when particles come into close proximity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++11 compiler
- Conan package manager
- CMake

### Building and Running

1. Clone repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeutrinoZh/space-simulation.git
```

2. Install dependencies using conan
```bash
conan install . --build=missing
```
